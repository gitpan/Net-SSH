This module implements a Perl interface to ssh.  It is a simple wrapper around
the system `ssh' command.  For an all-perl implementation that does not require
the system `ssh' command, see Net::SSH::Perl.

To install:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test # nothing substantial yet
        make install

Documentation will then be available via `man Net:SSH' or `perldoc Net::SSH'
