This module implements a Perl interface to ssh.  It is a simple wrapper around
the system `ssh' command.  For a perl implementation that does not require
the system B<ssh> command, see L<Net::SSH::Perl> instead.  For a wrapper
version that allows you to use passwords, see L<Net::SSH::Expect> instead.
For another non-forking version that uses the libssh2 library, see 
L<Net::SSH2>.  For a way to execute remote Perl code over an ssh connection
see L<IPC::PerlSSH>.

To install:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test # nothing substantial yet
        make install

Documentation will then be available via `man Net:SSH' or `perldoc Net::SSH'

Anonymous CVS access is available:
  $ export CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@cleanwhisker.420.am:/home/cvs/cvsroot"
  $ cvs login
  (Logging in to anonymous@pouncequick.cleanwhisker.420.am)
  CVS password: anonymous
  $ cvs checkout Net-SSH
as well as <http://www.420.am/cgi-bin/cvsweb/Net-SSH>.

Assitance wanted - this module could really use a maintainer with enough time
to at least review and apply more patches.  Or the module should just be
deprecated in favor of Net::SSH::Expect or made into an ::Any style
compatibility wrapper that uses whatver implementation is avaialble
(Net::SSH2, Net::SSH::Perl or shelling out like the modules does now).  Please
email if you are interested in helping.
